This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

I added axios, react-redux, json-server, react-router, scss file and added Bulma css in to make create-react-app complete

But first please install
```
yarn global add json-server
```
"json-server" will launch run an fake API from the file "db.json"

Then, the command below
```
yarn install && yarn start
```
